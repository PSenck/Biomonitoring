# Biomonitoring
A toolbox to automate and facilitate Biomonitoring

The Experiment class can read and preprocess data from different measurement techniques in the lab.

The Model class has basic functionalities for an parameter estimation based on simulated data and experimental data saved in the Experiment class.

The yeast class is derived from the Model class and contains the kinetic model for a yeast fed batch fermentation and a simulation routine.

The visualization module can visualize simulated and experimental data.

The testing_Yeast module is an ipynb jupyter file for testing the other modules. If you want to test it for yourself, adjust the path at the beginning of the file.

The Messdaten folder contains the experimental data and corresponds to your path.

The folder Docs\_build\html contains the docs of all the functions and classes. Load and open in fire-fox if you want to see the outcome of the .html files.
